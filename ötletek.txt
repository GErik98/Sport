For an admin dashboard, you might want to include options related to user management, event management, and perhaps some general site settings. Here are some menu options you could consider:

User Management:

Add User
View Users
Edit User
Ban User
Delete User
Event Management:

Add Event
View Events
Edit Event
Cancel Event
Delete Event
Site Settings:

General Settings
Theme Settings
Security Settings
Reports:

User Activity
Event Attendance
Site Usage Statistics
System Logs:

View Logs
Clear Logs
Help/Support:

Documentation
Contact Support
Remember, the actual options will depend on the specific features and functionalities of your website. Once you click on a menu option, you can use JavaScript (or a front-end framework like React or Vue.js) to update the content dynamically without triggering a full page reload.

For example, you can use AJAX to fetch the content for the selected option and update the container section. This way, the navigation bar stays in place while only the relevant content gets updated.
